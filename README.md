# ai-powered-personalized-tutor-system

An intelligent adaptive learning platform that:  üìä Predicts student performance using ML models (85% accuracy target)  üéØ Recommends personalized learning paths based on cognitive levels üëç Dynamically adapts study materials using NLP (text simplification/enhancement) üìù Makes promotion decisions with 50% confidence threshold

## Overview

This project is an AI-powered adaptive learning system that personalizes educational content for students based on their individual learning patterns, performance, and cognitive levels. By leveraging machine learning and natural language processing techniques, the system creates a tailored learning experience for each user.

## Features

- **Personalized Content Generation**: Automatically creates customized learning materials based on student's learning style and progress
- **ML-Based Performance Prediction**: Utilizes machine learning models to predict student outcomes with high accuracy
- **Cognitive Level Assessment**: Evaluates and adapts to students' cognitive capabilities
- **NLP-Enhanced Study Materials**: Simplifies or enhances text content according to student needs
- **Progress Visualization**: Interactive dashboards for monitoring student development
- **Smart Recommendation Engine**: Suggests appropriate learning resources and next steps
- **Streamlit Web Interface**: User-friendly application for students and educators
